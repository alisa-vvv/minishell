>>> EDGE CASES 

- 'export empty= ""' -> 'echo hi > $EMPTY'
- '<<<eof' -> cntrl+D -> 'echo $?'
- '>ls' -> 'ls' -> './les'
- '>haha | ls'
- 'export empty=" "' -> 'echo hi > $EMPTY' -> '$EMPTY echo hi'
- export $BLA>hey   (we need to check if exporting with a pipe or something in the name breaks)
- >hey ls               (need to check how we can make a default if the input is missing for a redirect)
