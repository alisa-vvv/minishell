This is a map of memory allocations for minishell.
It lists all heap allocations that are used across different submodules of the program, and documents how they are handled.
These allocations are highly relevant because they need to be freed whenever the program exits and persist throughout the program's run cycle.
All allocations not listed here should be freed within the scope of their functions or submodules.

		## NOTE: 2. and 3. both belong to t_exec_data. t_exec_data should be allocated on stack and not heap for ease/speed - ? are you sure? null the values then?
